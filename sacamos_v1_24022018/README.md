		<h3>\
			SACAMOS Mobile App\
		</h3>\
		<p>\
			This app was built in 2018 as part of my final year project to allow construction of CAD based electrical cable models on mobile devices to be exported for use in SPICE simulations in electronic circuit design. (My degree was in Electronic and Computer engineering)\
		</p>\
\
		<p> The app uses a basic client-server architecture to complete its modelling</p>\
		<p> The JAVA android front end allows users to input model parameters, access and export previous builds and manage cables</p>\
		<p> The high performance requirements for generating models meant that I had to build a separate backend in C++, that receives queued requests to process parameters into CAD models store them in a cloud based database for later access by the users</p>\
